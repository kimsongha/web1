  JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] JavaScript
  enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
  The vast majority of websites use it,[11] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and
imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.
It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM,
but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or
graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to
provide these features.
